## üîç What Inside This Project?
![Puzzle](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ALalScvjL.jpg)

**IQ Puzzle Pro** is a board game produced by the Smart Games company. The objective of the game is for the player to fill the entire board with the available pieces (puzzle blocks).
### Game Components

#### 1. Board
The board serves as the playing area where all the puzzle blocks must be placed without any gaps or overlaps.

#### 2. Blocks / Pieces
Each puzzle block has a unique shape and must be arranged to completely fill the board. Players can rotate or reflect the blocks as needed.

### Game Rules & Objective
The game begins with an empty board. Players must strategically place each puzzle block, ensuring that:
- No blocks overlap (except in 3D challenges).
- All blocks fit perfectly within the board.
- The board is fully covered when the puzzle is completed.

### Project Goal
This project aims to find a valid solution to the IQ Puzzler Pro game using the **Brute Force algorithm**. If no solution exists, the program will indicate that the puzzle cannot be solved.

## ‚ú® How to Use

### 1. **Linear System Solver**
   - Solve systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, Gauss-Jordan elimination, Cramer's rule, and matrix inversion methods.

### 2. **Matrix Operations**
   - Perform operations such as matrix multiplication, transposition, finding the determinant, and calculating the inverse of matrices.

### 3. **Regression Analysis**
   - Supports both **Multiple Linear Regression** and **Quadratic Regression** for data analysis.

### 4. **Interpolation**
   - Polynomial interpolation and **Bicubic Spline Interpolation** for estimating values between data points.

### 5. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - An intuitive GUI for easier interaction with the library, allowing users to perform operations without needing to use the command line.

### 6. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
   - A fully-featured CLI for power users who prefer or need to interact with the application through terminal commands.

### 7. **Image Resizing and Stretching**
