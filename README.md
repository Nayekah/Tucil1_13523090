## üîç What Inside This Project?
![Puzzle](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ALalScvjL.jpg)

**IQ Puzzle Pro** is a board game produced by the Smart Games company. The objective of the game is for the player to fill the entire board with the available pieces (puzzle blocks).
### Game Components

#### 1. Board
The board serves as the playing area where all the puzzle blocks must be placed without any gaps or overlaps.

#### 2. Blocks / Pieces
Each puzzle block has a unique shape and must be arranged to completely fill the board. Players can rotate or reflect the blocks as needed.

### Game Rules & Objective
The game begins with an empty board. Players must strategically place each puzzle block, ensuring that:
- No blocks overlap (except in 3D challenges).
- All blocks fit perfectly within the board.
- The board is fully covered when the puzzle is completed.

### Project Goal
This project aims to find a valid solution to the IQ Puzzler Pro game using the **Brute Force algorithm**. If no solution exists, the program will indicate that the puzzle cannot be solved.
